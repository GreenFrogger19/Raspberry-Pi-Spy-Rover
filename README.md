## Motivation

This past summer I wanted to build a remote controlled car that would be able to stream video from its point of view, so that I would be able see what it “sees” while controlling it from somewhere else. After researching different options, I decided that using a raspberry pi was the best choice for building this spy rover because there were many available Raspberry Pi kits, tutorials and resources that would help me out. After constructing the spy rover, I then wanted to be able to control it through a GUI because I was not satisfied with just controlling it with a python program through a terminal using ssh. This is what led me to create the Spy Rover GUI.

## Lessons Learned

* **Time management:**
	One of the primary lessons that this project reinforced in me was that everything takes more time than you think it will. While I am quite good at planning my time in regards to school work, the fact that this project was not preplanned by one of my professors resulted in me running into lots of unexpected problems. Now I have become much better at planning for these unexpected problems.

* **Familiarity with Linux:**
	Since I used Raspbian, which is based on the Debian Linux distribution, for my Raspberry Pi’s operating system, this project helped me become much more familiar with using a Linux terminal.

* **More Experience with Python:**
	While the python coding that I did for this project was much less complicated than what I did in the python course I took at Penn State, this project still helped me keep my python skills from growing dull and it taught me a bunch about the python TkInter GUI library.
